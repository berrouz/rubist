- Show me a cool project you’ve worked on. How did you do it

- Last but not least, tell me something about the following principles:
  DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, optimistic vs. pessimistic locking, MVC vs. MVVM, (list can go on…)

- Functional programming

 # functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation
 # of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data
 # The biggest difference is that Imperative programming is about Control flow while Functional programming is about Data flow
 
- Proc functional programming

 # Often recursive.
 # Always returns the same output for a given input.
 # Order of evaluation is usually undefined.
 # Must be stateless. i.e. No operation can have side effects.
 # Good fit for parallel execution
 # Tends to emphasize a divide and conquer approach.
 # May have the feature of Lazy Evaluation.
