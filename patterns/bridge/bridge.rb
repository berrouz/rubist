# The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class 
# into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets
# classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible
# interfaces
# The adapter pattern is usually used when you don't have control over
# the target class. It also bridge the gap between two classes that have no relation
# - work with 3rd party libraries
